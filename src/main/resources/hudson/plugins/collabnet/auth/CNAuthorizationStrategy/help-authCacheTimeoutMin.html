    Authorization information queried from the appserver can be cached in Jenkins to improve page load and reduce
    appserver load.  Cached permissions does not persist across user sessions, and setting this value to zero or below
    turns off all caching.

    It is highly recommended that this at least be set to a small value to prevent generating excessive appserver load.
