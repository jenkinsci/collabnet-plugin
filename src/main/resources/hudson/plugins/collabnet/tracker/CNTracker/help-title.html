  <p>
  The title that will be used for newly created issue.  This string
  will also used when Jenkins updates an existing issue.
  </p>
  <p>
  You may include environmental variables, referred to by ${ENV_VAR_NAME}, 
    that will be 
    interpreted at runtime in this field.<br/>
    For example, your title might be "Jenkins build failed for
  ${JOB_NAME}.".<br/>
    See <a href='/env-vars.html' target=_new>the list of available
  environment variables</a>.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
  Adding environmental variables -- ${BUILD_ID}, for example -- that
  change between runs will cause new issues to be opened whenever the
  build fails. Alternatively, choosing a title that will not change
  between runs will insure that all build status activity is directed
  to a single tracker issue.
