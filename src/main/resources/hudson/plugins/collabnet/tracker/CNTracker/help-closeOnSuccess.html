  If set to 'yes', the last submitted open issue will be closed if the
  Jenkins build succeeds. No user intervention will be required.
  </p>
  <p>
  If set to 'no', the last submitted open issue will be updated with a
  success message, but left open. A user in the project will have to
  manually close the issue.

  NOTE: If your tracker has any workflow (status transition) rules, Jenkins
  will not be able to close your issue automatically if there is a
  conflict with a workflow rule.
